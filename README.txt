PROJECT:

Very plain website created to test EJS skills. 

Creating a dynamic website which allows the use of templates in order to create new pages/urls.

USE:

Allows users to add new posts to the home page. This then stores the post in the homepage but limited to 100 chars with a "Read More" link
that allows user to navigate to that post on a different page to view full post.

Multiple posts are stored in the home page.
